# Alternatives

If doxysphinx doesn't fit your needs maybe there are some other open source tools which might be a better fit:

* [Breathe](https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe)
* [Exhale](https://github.com/svenevs/exhale)
* [Doxyrest](https://github.com/vovkos/doxyrest)
* [wurfapi](https://github.com/steinwurf/wurfapi)
* [sphinxcontrib-autodoc_doxygen](https://github.com/rmcgibbo/sphinxcontrib-autodoc_doxygen)

These seem abandoned:

* [gasp](https://github.com/troelsfr/Gasp)
* [doxygraph](https://github.com/jitsuCM/doxygraph)
