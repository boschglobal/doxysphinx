# Rst Inline Syntax

## TLDR; Recommended Syntax

Use the following (note that you have to replace the backticks usually used in rst/sphinx with quotes):

```cpp
/// lorem ipsum, `:role:"content of the role"` dolor sit...
```

e.g.

```cpp
/// Here you can find the `:doc:"Main Documentation <index>"`. Please read it carefully.
```

This will work only if markdown support is activated in doxygen (highly recommended).
Futhermore, please note that **you can only use sphinx roles and domains** in the inline syntax for now
(reasoning see below).

See below in the methods documentation for other options if you have markdown support disabled.

## Technical details

Skip this section if you're not interested in the technical details...

Inline rst is a major problem because of the following:

1. Paragraphs all over the place

   Doxygen uses paragraph `<p>`-html-tags for it's content. Paragraph tags cannot have other block-level
   tags inside them (even no other paragraph tags). The browsers (chromium-based, firefox etc.) are quite
   aggressive in fixing bad nestings here (just to be able to display a page) so e.g. if a nested `<p>`-tag
   is noticed the browsers will close the outer `<p>`-tag right before the inner `<p>`-tag. This will linearize
   the `<p>`-tags and the page could be rendered.

   When we now split our content for mixed rst content as described in `:doc:"/docs/inner_workings"` we end
   up having raw-html blocks and inline-rst blocks (and also other rst blocks but that doesn't matter here).
   Sphinx will automagically put `<p>`-tags around the inline-rst-block - it's doing that around all pure
   text based content and we cannot change that.

   Most of the time this results in an html structure with nested p tags which will be "fixed" by the
   browsers on loading/rendering of the html page. Why is this a problem? because we cannot style
   (in a css sense) away the blockiness if we have only sibling `<p>`-tags.
   Also we cannot fix the final html structure because we're too early in the process. We can only create rsts
   which will then be picked up by sphinx to create html.

2. Doxygen interpretation/preprocessing

   The main use case for inline rst are sphinx roles which are normally written in a form like:

   ```plain
   :role_name:`role_content`
   ```

   but doxygens internal markdown support will parse the backticks as markdown inline code block and renders
   code-tags all over the place then.

the following solutions/hacks have been applied to overcome the problems:

1. If we encounter a sphinx role in doxysphinx during original doxygen html parsing we change it's
   parent html tag from `<p>`-tag to `<div>`-tag (because divs can have nested content). We also add a css
   class which we use to style the "blockiness" away (display:inline). The technical implementation is
   has more complexity - if you're interested just look into the code.

2. Doxysphinx scans the html for `<code>`-tags but that's not enough. For doxysphinx to consider a code tag as inline
   sphinx snippet it has to be in the format ``<code>:role:`content`</code>``. The content can be delimited not only
   by backticks.
   Backticks are also markdown's verbatim inline delimiters and therefore can only be used when escaped (and even
   then they create problems with doxygen's way of parsing).
   Therefore we're also supporting quotes and ticks or no quotes at all (in that case we put them automatically after the :role: part and before the end).

   The implication is that **you cannot use anything other than roles/domains for inline rst**. In practice this
   means that you cannot use rst's external link syntax and references for now, which is however so cryptic that
   we're quite sure that you would rather consider using doxygens link command or just a markdown link.

## Supported rst inline delimiters in doxygen comments

Technically doxysphinx searches for `<pre>`- or `<div class="fragment">`-elements in doxygen html output
because these are the elements it uses for verbatim code block content. There are several ways in doxygen to
create these kind of elements:

### markdown inline block

You can use markdown inline code syntax:

```cpp
/// A markdown inline statement with quotes like this - `:doc:"Main Documentation <index>"` - will work.
```

```{warning}
The role content delimiter has to be a quote ("). Ticks and escaped backticks won't work with markdown inline
code syntax because of doxygens parser.
```

### `<code>`-html-element

You can also use a html `<code>`-element:

```cpp
/// A html code element with quotes like this - <code>:doc:"Main Documentation <index>"</code> - will work.
///
/// A html code element with ticks like this - <code>:doc:'Main Documentation <index>'</code> - will work.
///
/// A html code element with escaped backticks like this - <code>:doc:\`Main Documentation <index>\`</code> - will work.
```

### `<tt>`-html-element

You can also use a html `<tt>`-element:

```cpp
/// A html tt element with quotes like this - <tt>:doc:"Main Documentation <index>"</tt> - will work.
///
/// A html tt element with ticks like this - <tt>:doc:'Main Documentation <index>'</tt> - will work.
///
/// A html tt element with escaped backticks like this - <tt>:doc:\`Main Documentation <index>\`</tt> - will work.
```
