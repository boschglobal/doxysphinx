.. warning:: no content after the delimiters

   In markdown it's typical to have the language right behind the beginning codeblock delimiter.
   Something like ```cpp for example. However the doxygen markdown parser will swallow
   anything behin the delimiters (which means we couldn't make use of information there). So please do
   not fall into the trap trying to start a rst block with ```{rst}!

    Just Text

.. tip::

   If you see a tip around this text it worked!

    <snippet type="rst:block">
.. tip:: another test

   this is just another test
   here's a codeblock right at the end
