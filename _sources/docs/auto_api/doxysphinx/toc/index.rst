      :return: a string interable representing the lines forming the toctree directive



.. py:class:: DoxygenTocGenerator(source_dir: pathlib.Path)

   A TocGenerator for doxygen.

   Will read the menudata.js to check whether a toctree
   directive needs to be generated or not.


   .. py:attribute:: structural_dummies


   .. py:method:: generate_toc_for(file: pathlib.Path) -> Iterator[str]

      Generate a toctree directive for a given file.

      structure.
      :param file: the file to generate the toctree directive for
      :return: a string iterator representing the lines forming the toctree directive
