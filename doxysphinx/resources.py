    This is done with the help of libsass (as the sass-syntax extends css with nesting).

    Our original problem was that the doxygen stylesheet and the sphinx theme stylesheets collide in some
    ways (e.g. global styles like heading-styles etc...). We therefore needed to have a mechanism to apply
    doxygen stylesheets only to doxygen content (not to the outer sphinx theme shell). We do this via sass,
    because sass is css compatible but adds some nice features to it. You can for example nest styles.
    We use that here to define an outer class and nest the whole doxygen stylesheet below it in a temporary
    sass stylesheet which then gets compiled back to css. With this
    we kill 2 birds with one stone:
    * all doxygen rules are now scoped so they are not applied to the sphinx bits shell anymore....
    * all doxygen rules now are more specialized than any of the outer sphinx style rules (they will win in browser).

    In the end that means that sphinx styles are applied to sphinx bits and doxygen styles are applied to
    doxygen bits. We still need to fix some minor issues with a custom stylesheet (which we also apply here).
